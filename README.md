Hello! :D Im Aeven and this is a tool I made for unity! It's pourpuso is to take scn files and open them in unity and viceversa!

You can fin a wip guide here: https://github.com/Aeven-Dev/UnityScnTool/wiki please refer to is for any simple questions like how to do something basic, like importing, exporting, animating, etc :D

If the guide wasnt usefull feel free to contact me! I'll try to answer your questions! You can also suggest things you'd like to see happen, and if it's posible i'll try to make them!

I want to give my thanks to wtfblub and their awesome library that made this posible https://github.com/wtfblub/NetspherePirates
