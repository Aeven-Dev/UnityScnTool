# UnityScnTool

## Instalation! :D Take your first steps in s4 modding!
Firs and foremost, you're gonna need unity! The version this was developed was 2012.2.7f1, so use that one or later ones to avoid missing some uinty functionality that I use like UIElements. You also need to have probuilder, this is because i still dont know how to make probuilder support modular.

So you'll need to make an unity project of course, i recomend using the standart rendering pipeline since it's not like anything from the shaders would translate to S4. On the other hand if you want to get things out of s4 for yourself then do as you wish!

Now that you have your project it's time to add this baby! Download the zip and extract it in a folder called "ScnToolByAeven" in the folder "Assets" So it should look like this:<br>
-Assets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-ScnToolByAeven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-BlubsScnTool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Editor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-SCript<br>
        
The reason for this is that i do some stuff that needs to know that that's the folder structure im working with. I'll change it to something better in the future but for now it is what it is.

 If you dont know how to install ProBuilder then inside your Unity project:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Window > Asset Store > Open Package Manager.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Packages: In Project" change to "Package: Unity Registry".<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In the search field type: ProBuilder.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Install.<br>

Now if everything was installed correctly you should see some options inside the Window menu:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S4 SCn Window <3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animation Window! :D<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Load Aaaaall maps!!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S4Scn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CharacterLoader<br>
